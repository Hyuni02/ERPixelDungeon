windows.wndstory.sewers=PM 15:57 / Sunny / Visibility, 10NM\nOutside Chernobog, wilderness\n\nThere is an anti-aircraft threat, so the operation begins outside the mobile city "Chernobog". It is an environment difficult for humans to live in due to the frequent winds of originium, but some infected creatures live here for a day.\n\nNumerous infectious organisms and some reunions are stationed there, but this is not even considered as dangerous.
windows.wndstory.prison=PM 21:12 / Cloudy / Visibility, 5NM\n4 NM from the city center of Chernobog\n\nDefeated Sarkaz guarding the gate and successfully entered Chernobog. When you woke up, it was already after the sun of Terra had set. Reunion discovered Rhodes Island's involvement and began sending drones, casters and night operations units into the city.\n\nThreat drones flying through the air and Sarkaz casters were deployed. Don't take a distance from them.
windows.wndstory.caves=AM 02:42 / Cloudy / Visibility, 4NM\nSomewhere in the town of Chernobog, inside a cave\n\nA cave where infected people lived in Chernobog. It is a shortcut to the city center.\nThey began to gather one by one into the cave to escape the persecution of the uninfected and at the same time avoid a "disaster". But they disappeared somewhere. Instead, Reunion and some infected creatures are guarding this place.\n\nSpecial warfare casters and revengers were dispatched to this place. Defeat enemies using active tactics.
windows.wndstory.city=AM 07:28 / Lightning / Visibility, 2NM\nChernobog city center, the road to the core\n\nShe had her bloodshed a little, but she cleared up her misunderstanding with her. According to Mud Rock, she evacuated the infected who had been hiding here to Raitanien. You reached the city center of Chernobog. A "disaster" has already begun in this area. The sky is darkened by catastrophic clouds, lightning is falling from somewhere, and polluted Originium ores are sprouting from the ground. Some of the reunions here have gone crazy with the Originium reaction caused by the disaster, or their body has started to mutate.\n\nEnemies that have become stronger due to Originium erosion are roaming around. It will be difficult to defeat them with a normal attack.
windows.wndstory.halls=AM 12:06 / Earthquake with lightning / Visibility, 600YDS\nLandmark tower with the core of Chernobog\n\nChernobog is running towards the centre of the disaster, and it seems that someone has adjusted the core and repositioned it arbitrarily.\nThe mastermind behind all these riots is in this tower. She sided with the sarkaz mercenary army, ready to crush her invaders mercilessly. Now you are faced with absurdly powerful enemies, but remembering your comrades waiting for victory, you are now able to bear all of this.\n\nWatch your steps. The field of view here is always narrow, and the enemies will pose a great threat to you out of sight.
