journal.document.adventurers_guide.identifying.title=Items
journal.document.adventurers_guide.identifying.body=I trust you have already seen items lying about in Chernobog.\n\nAs you get your hands on them, you won't know the item's "functions" or whether it is "safe".\n"Stone of Intuition" and "Diary of Identify" is what you need in those situations. Enchanting _Diary of Identify_ to make _Diary of Divination_ is also an option.\n\n...\n-Equipment : May be cursed with Reunion's Arts. Cursed equipments cannot be taken off and are very dangerous, so be careful.\n\n-Potions and Diaries : Only use unidentified items when you are safe! Also, don't think that identified Potions or Diaries will look the same in the next mission!\n\n...Kal'tsit never gets to the point. -Closure

journal.document.adventurers_guide.examining_and_searching.body=I should just ask someone other than Kal'tsit to write these... Oh, hey, can you help?\n\nKey to every exploration is caution! It will be big trouble charging in recklessly. There may be traps, or secret passages. Considering all of those is the key to exploring!\n\nBy clicking on the magnifying glass on the bottom left and clicking the target, you may know more about them.\n\nAlso, click on it twice and you may search for traps or anything hidden around you! However! This takes a turn, so be careful!\n\n-Magallan
journal.document.adventurers_guide.strength.title=Growth
journal.document.adventurers_guide.strength.body=There won't be any time to train in Chernobog. Understand? This isn't Rhodes Island.\n\nFind Potions of Strength if you want to get stronger.

Diary of Upgrade will make equipments stronger and also more manageable, allowing it to be equipped with lower Stength. There should be three Diary of Upgrade every five floors.\n\n-Dobermann
journal.document.adventurers_guide.food.title=Hunger
journal.document.adventurers_guide.food.body=It's stressful to be hungry! But sometimes it's better to stay hungry...\n\nI know that starving is bad for your health, and being full restores it!

That way, you can eat your food to restore health.\n\n-Gummy\n\n"Just eat when your health is at a half." -N. C. 
journal.document.adventurers_guide.levelling.title=Gaining Experience
journal.document.adventurers_guide.levelling.body=As you defeat enemies your level of experience will increase. Your experience determines how accurate your attacks are, how easily you can dodge, and how much health you have.\n\nAnyway, being higher level is good, so don't avoid combat and level up! Right, I'm done with this. I should go get lunch with Lava. Oh hey, Kokodayo~\n\nJeez, she didn't finish this off... Anyway, if the level difference between you and the enemy is too great, you can't gain any experience. Just keep it in mind. -Employee L

journal.document.adventurers_guide.surprise_attacks.body=Surprise Attack. Always effective.\n\nI know. Attack from outside the enemy's line of sight. Never misses.\n\nMost surefire way is to attack when the enemy has just reached the door.\nOr walk around a wall or tall grass with stabbing in between. That works too.\n\nWhen Surprise Attack is performed, yellow exclamation mark appears. That's how you know. -Projekt Red
journal.document.adventurers_guide.dieing.title=Handling Defeat
journal.document.adventurers_guide.dieing.body=This mission is very dangerous. There is no guarantee of success.\n\nDon't be dissuaded should you fail.

Focus on learning the game and steadily improving, don't focus on winning right away.
journal.document.adventurers_guide.looting.title=Effective Looting
journal.document.adventurers_guide.looting.body=1. Locked chests or doors can be opened with keys, find them.\n\n2. If there are no keys, find a spot upstairs where you can fall down from.\n\n3. A way to overcome every obstacle is generated in the same floor, look for it.\n\n4. With nothing left behind, there's 15 Diary of Upgrade and 10 Potion of Strength.\n\n...This is correct, right? -Jessica
journal.document.adventurers_guide.magic.title=Arts Attacks
journal.document.adventurers_guide.magic.body=Arts Attacks ignore defense and evasion, but it cannot be used if there's no charge left in the staff.\n\nEnemy Arts is also dangerous.
