windows.wndstory.sewers=PM 15:57 / Sunny / Visibility, 10NM\nOutside Chernobog, Wastelands\n\nDue to an anti-air threat, the operation begins outside the mobile city "Chernobog". It is an environment difficult for humans to live in due to the frequent storms consisting Originium, but some Infected Creatures live here day by day.\n\nNumerous Infected Creatures and forces of Reunion are stationed there, but this is far from being actually dangerous.
windows.wndstory.prison=PM 21:12 / Cloudy / Visibility, 5NM\nSuburbs, 4 NM from downtown Chernobog\n\nAfter defeating the Sarkaz guarding the gate, Chernobog finally opened its doors. The sun of Terra has already set. Reunion discovered Rhodes Island's involvement and began sending drones, Casters and night op units into the city.\n\nThere are many dangerous drones and Sarkaz casters roaming the area. Do not give them the advantage of distance.
windows.wndstory.caves=AM 02:42 / Cloudy / Visibility, 4NM\nSomewhere in the suburbs of Chernobog, Cave inteior\n\nA cave where the Infected lived in Chernobog, and shortcut to downtown.\nThey began to gather one by one into the cave to escape the persecution and "Catastrophe". However, at present they are gone. Instead, Reunion and Infected Creatures are guarding this place.\n\nSpec Ops Casters and Revengers were dispatched to this place. Defeat the enemies swift tactics.
windows.wndstory.city=AM 07:28 / Thunderstorm / Visibility, 2NM\nDowntown Chernobog, Path to the Core\n\nAlthough there was small bloodshed, but the misunderstanding was cleared. According to Mudrock, she evacuated the Infected who had been hiding here to Leithania. Downtown Chernobog at last. A "Catastrophe" has already begun to brew in the area. The sky is darkened by Catastrophic clouds, lightning falls, and polluted Originium ores are sprouting from the ground. Reunion forces are either driven crazy with Originium reaction caused by the Catastrophe or mutations are happening to their body.\n\nEnemies that have become stronger from Originium erosion are roaming the area. It will be difficult to defeat them with normal methods.
windows.wndstory.halls=AM 12:06 / Earthquake with Thuderstorms/ Visibility, 600YDS\nLandmark tower around the Core of Chernobog\n\nChernobog is running towards the center of the Catastrophe, and it seems that someone has adjusted the core and repositioned the destination arbitrarily.\nThe mastermind behind all these riots is in this tower. She allied with the Sarkaz mercenaries, ready to crush her invaders mercilessly. Now the enemies are almost unfairly strong, but upon remembering friends waiting for victory, all of this starts to become bearable.\n\nWatch your steps. The field of view here is always narrow, and the enemies will pose a great threat to you out of sight.
